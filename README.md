# 🔥 Alberta Wildfire Analysis (2020–2023)

This project presents an interactive wildfire analytics dashboard built using **Python** and **Power BI**. By analyzing open data from the Government of Alberta, we explored wildfire trends, causes, weather influence, and regional risk to support smarter wildfire response planning.

## 📌 Project Overview

Wildfires in Alberta are growing in size and frequency, yet much of the historical data remains underutilized. This project aimed to:
- **Analyze Alberta wildfires from 2020 to 2023**
- Build a centralized dashboard for **data-driven decision-making**
- Identify high-risk regions and causes
- Explore how weather patterns affect fire spread
